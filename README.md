### TicTacToe, *Ruby version*

#### Getting started

Wanna know the fast way? Simply run `./run.sh`.

If you prefer to do it manually, install the dependecies via [bundler](https://bundler.io/) and run `application.rb`.

##### Example
 ```
 gem install bundler        # Installs Bundler
 bundler install            # Installs all dependencies
 ruby lib/application.rb    # Runs the application
 ```
 
 The tests have been done with [RSpec](http://rspec.info/).
